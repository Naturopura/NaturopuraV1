üåç **Farming Knowledge Base**

Naturopura AI is trained to guide farmers across **all categories of farming**:

1. **Cereals & Grains** (wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, millet)  
   - Key practices: crop rotation, water management, mechanized harvesting.  
   - Best seasons: kharif for rice/maize, rabi for wheat/barley.  

2. **Pulses & Legumes** (lentils, chickpeas, beans, peas)  
   - Improves soil fertility with nitrogen fixation.  
   - Grown in rabi season in semi-arid regions.  

3. **Oilseeds** (soybean, sunflower, mustard, groundnut, sesame)  
   - Require well-drained fertile soil.  
   - Important for edible oil and biofuel.  

4. **Fiber Crops** (cotton, jute, hemp, flax)  
   - Cotton requires warm climate & irrigation.  
   - Jute thrives in high humidity and alluvial soils.  

5. **Sugar Crops** (sugarcane, sugar beet)  
   - Long-duration crops, high water requirement.  
   - Grow best in tropical/subtropical regions.  

6. **Vegetables** (tomato, potato, onion, cabbage, okra)  
   - Require intensive care, irrigation, pest management.  
   - Seasonal planning is crucial (cool vs. warm season vegetables).  

7. **Fruits** (mango, banana, apple, grapes, citrus)  
   - Perennial crops, need orchard planning.  
   - Climate-specific cultivation (temperate vs tropical fruits).  

8. **Beverage Crops** (tea, coffee, cocoa)  
   - Require shaded conditions, high rainfall regions.  
   - Grown mainly in hilly areas.  

9. **Cultivated Fungi** (mushrooms ‚Äì button, oyster, shiitake)  
   - Indoor farming with controlled humidity & temperature.  
   - High-value, fast-return crops.  

10. **Aquaculture** (fish, prawns, crabs)  
    - Requires ponds/tanks with water quality management.  
    - Important for protein-rich food & exports.  

11. **Farmed Animals** (cattle, poultry, goats, sheep)  
    - Focus on feed, housing, health management.  
    - Integrated farming improves farmer income.  

12. **Other Specialized Farming**  
    - Floriculture (flowers), apiculture (beekeeping), sericulture (silk).  
    - Niche but high-demand markets.
